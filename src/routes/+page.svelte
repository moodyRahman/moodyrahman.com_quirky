			<div class="tool-tip">
				<div>
					computer science capstone project. me and two teammates built an emulator for the Chip-8,
					a fully online interface for the emulator, a debugger, and an IDE. The debugger consists
					of a UI that displays the currently executing ROM, the CPU register states, and the
					ability to adjust CPU speed in real-time. The IDE features an assembler that compiles
					source code directly into the web emulator, and additional tooling to aid in development.
					The frontend was implemented in Svelte, with the emulator implemented in AssemblyScript
					that compiled to WebAssembly.

			<div class="tool-tip">
				<div>
					1kv is a still under development showcase of all my destiny 2 clips, complete with
					descriptions of why something was clip-worthy. build with sveletekit, it queries into my
					CMS (https://strapi.moodyrahman.com/) at compile time and generates all the HTML then
					(SSG). the ultimate goal for this project is to design a pipeline such that I can upload a
					clip, and it'll automatically compress the video, generate a thumbnail for it, and create
					its corresponding entry in the CMS. Thinking about porting it over to use youtube instead
					of hosting the clips here because YT is so much better at handling videos than me.

					i have a very particular sense of aesthetic that's very evident by the design of my site.
					this is a little utility that helps me rapidly try new colors without needing to write
					css. it also encodes a given palette into the URL, creating a hard URL for any and every
					palette.

				<div>
					autoindexed directories are pretty ugly, as anyone who's ever browsed a package repo is
					painfully aware of. one of the more well documented ways of styling an nginx generated
					autoindexed directory is via XSLT (eXtensible Stylesheet Language Transformations). here
					is the xslt code I wrote to handle my file server.
